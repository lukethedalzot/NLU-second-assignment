    "##Evaluate spaCy NER on CoNLL 2003 data, token-level performance (per class and total)\n",
    "- accuracy of correctly recognizing all tokens that belong to named entities\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing is to correctly read the sentences inside the CoNLL dataset, which is done by using the function `read_corpus_conll` from the conll.py script. But since its output are the sentences collected in a `list of list of list`, I implemented a function (`getSentences`) which takes as input the result of `read_corpus_conll`, and will output `list` where the full sentences from the dataset are stored. After collecting all of the sentences that will be then fed to `spacy`, using the function `getSentencesTag` I can create a `list of list of tuple` where the ground truth for the evaluation is stored. This was done basically in the same way as for the `getSentences` function, but istead of simply appending each token to the other, I create a tuple of `token` and `ent_tag` which will be used in the comparison of spacy's NER. \n",
    "Speaking of which, with the function `getSpacyTag` I take as input the `list` of sentences, and for each one of them will create a `list of tuples` that will contain `token` and `ent_tag`, but since `spacy` has a different way of tokenizing certain words some manipulation was done (for example dates like `19-04-2020` would be splitted in three for each number, while on the CoNLL dataset it is trated as a single token). So with the use of the `whitespace` property I was able to detect those istances and with the help of a function I created `getWord`, which takes a `doc` object and the index numeber of the processed token and will output the full \"span\" that constitute as the whole token in the CoNLL dataset and another index number of the immidiate next token that will come after the processed one (index that will be used in the `getSpacyTag` function to essentially skip those \"extra\" tokens that are recognized by `spacy` but are already given out by the `getWord` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that I all have all that's necessary to make an evaluation I create two variables to count all of the tokens and the ones that are correctly recognized, I also create two `dict` to store all the counts and the correct ones that will have as keys the four types of entities recognized in the CoNLL dataset times two because the tokens can be inside the entity `I-ENT` or its beginning `B-ENT`, and also a key for the non-entity type `O`. \n",
    "\n",
    "I should also point out that since CoNLL \"only\" uses four entity types while spacy recognizes 18 of them, a part of the `getSpacyTag` is dedicated to correctly associating `spacy` tags to the CoNLL ones, basically if a spacy tag was `GPE` it was reported as `LOC`, and the `PERSON` one was simply converted to `PER`, the `LOC` and `ORG` remained untouched while all of the others were assigned to the `MISC` label. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I fell the need to point out is the reason why I computed the accuracy \"by hand\" is because the request was to compute the token-level preformance total and per class, and to do the latter I found out that using the function the professor suggested on piazza it was not possible. \n"

So by making use of a `temp` list, I monitor if the entity I'm on is still part of the same chunk as the one of the previous entity, if I am I simply append the tag of the entity to the one of the previous one, if I'm still in a chunk then probably I'm in a new chunk, so I can add to the output list `temp` if it's not empty, and then work on this new chunk. If I'm not in a chunk then again I can add to the output list `temp` if it's not empty, and then add to the output list this entity outside every chunk that still needs to be added since it is an entity."

To do so a `list` change is used so that before the function gives the output it updates all of the changed heads for the conpound tokens. \n"
