# NLU-second-assignment
This repository contains the notebook `Assignment2.ipynb` with my resolution of the second assignment for the NLU course of 2020/2021. 
The notebook also includes a description of all asked functions above each block separating the asked functions, and since in piazza it was specified that it can be done istead of creating a separate report document, I choose to put all in the notebook so that everithing is in one place.

# Requirements
`spacy` (and it's english model) was used as additional library
- run `conda install spacy` or `pip install spacy` for spacy itself
- run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` for the english model

Also `pandas` was used to print nice tables
- run `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`

Two functions from the `conll.py` script were used, the file itself can be found in the repo.

The dataset `test.txt` was used to evaluate the `spacy` model, also this file can be found in the repo.
